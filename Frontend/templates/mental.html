    Meditation</h3><br>

        <br>It helps change your response to negative thinking
Depression can involve a lot of dark thoughts. You might feel hopeless, worthless, or angry at life (or even yourself). This can make meditation seem somewhat counterintuitive, since it involves increasing awareness around thoughts and experiences.

But meditation teaches you to pay attention to thoughts and feelings without passing judgment or criticizing yourself.

Meditation doesn’t involve pushing away these thoughts or pretending you don’t have them. Instead, you notice and accept them, then let them go. In this way, meditation can help disrupt cycles of negative thinking.
These simple steps can help you get started:

        1. Get comfortable</h3><br>

    <div class="elementcontent">It’s often helpful to sit down when first learning meditation, but if you feel better standing up or lying down, that works, too.
The key is to feel comfortable and relaxed. Closing your eyes can also help.

        style="text-align: left; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-style: normal;font-weight: 550;font-size: 2rem;">
        2.Begin with your breath</h3><br>

    <div class="elementcontent">Take slow, deep breaths through your nose. For several seconds, just focus on breathing.
    Pay attention to:

how it feels to inhale
how it feels to exhale
the sounds of your breath
Your thoughts might wander away from your breath, and that’s pretty normal. Just keep redirecting your focus to breathing whenever you catch yourself thinking about something else.

        style="text-align: left; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-style: normal;font-weight: 550;font-size: 2rem;">
        3. Move from breath to body</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">Eventually, begin shifting your attention from your breath to the various parts of your body to perform what’s known as a body scan.

Start your body scan wherever you like. Some people find it more natural to start with their feet, while others prefer to start with their hands or head.

Focus your awareness on your body, moving from one part to the next. As you continue to breathe slowly and deeply, note how each body part feels.

Do any areas hurt? Or feel tense?

If you notice an unusual or troublesome sensation, like tension or aches, you can add a visualization exercise.

Imagine yourself sending relaxing breaths to that part of the body. Picture that tight muscle loosening and pain easing. Getting more comfortable with your bodily experiences and sensations can help you become more tuned in to changes as they come up.

When you’ve finished scanning your body, return your focus to your breathing for as long as you need.
