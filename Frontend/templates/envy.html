    <h1>Dealing With Envy</h1>

    Acknowledge envy</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">

    Admitting that we are experiencing envy can be very threatening, because it means acknowledging our own weakness and insecurity.

The first clue that envy is lurking may be irrational feelings of hostility towards the object of our envy. Just the sight of them might make your skin crawl, even though they have done nothing wrong that you can put your finger on.
        <br>

    </div> <br><br>
    <h3
        style="text-align: left; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-style: normal;font-weight: 550;font-size: 2rem;">
    Recognize that pride is just the flip side of the envy coin</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
    It is tempting—but generally unhelpful—to try to counteract envy with pride. “Sure, he has a nice car, but I’m better looking” is not going to get you very far. You might feel vindicated in the moment, but sooner or later someone is going to come along who has a nicer car than you and is better looking.

In other words, reassuring ourselves about our own enviable traits is unlikely to be sustainable, and it maintains the same unstable social comparison hierarchy where someone else needs to be put down in order for us to feel boosted up, and vice versa.

Instead of responding to the pain of envy with efforts to bolster your self-esteem, try self-compassion instead. Acknowledge that it is hard to see someone do well when you’re floundering, and remind yourself that you are very much not alone in your feelings of inadequacy. Even the most successful people suffer from self-doubt at times. Being imperfect is synonymous with being human.

    Replace envy with compassion</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
Although envy seems almost like a compliment, it can be quite dehumanizing. It reduces the object of envy to something very narrow and masks the full picture of who they are and what their life is like.

        Don’t forget to count your own blessings</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
    As the saying goes, envy is counting the other fellow’s blessings instead of your own.

Counting our blessings isn’t the same as boosting our ego by reminding ourselves how we’re better than others, as in the nice car/good looks example above. It’s more about refocusing on what is really important in life, and on the sometimes intangible or invisible things we do possess—and that are less dependent on social comparisons, like a strong spirit, a diversity of life experiences, or just the simple fact of being alive.
